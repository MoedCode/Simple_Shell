# Linux Ubuntu Shell Simulation

This project is a Linux Ubuntu shell simulation implemented in C, designed to provide a practice environment for learning C programming and Linux system concepts.

## Description

The Linux Ubuntu Shell Simulation project aims to replicate a basic shell environment found in Linux systems. It allows users to interact with the simulated shell, execute commands, and explore various shell functionalities. The project focuses on providing a hands-on learning experience for understanding C programming and Linux system calls.

## Features

- Command execution: Users can enter commands, and the shell simulation will execute them.
- Basic shell functionalities: The shell simulation supports common shell features like command parsing, executing external programs, and handling input/output redirection.
- Built-in commands: Some built-in commands, such as `cd`, `ls`, and `exit`, are implemented to provide a comprehensive shell experience.
- Error handling: Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- Practice exercises: The project includes practice exercises and examples to help users understand C programming concepts and Linux system calls better.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Linux Ubuntu Shell Simulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
1. Build the project using the provided Makefile or compile the source files manually using a C compiler.
1. Run the shell simulation executable.
1. Start exploring the shell simulation by entering commands and experimenting with different functionalities.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu)

## Usage

- Enter commands in the shell simulation to execute them.
- Use the built-in commands (`cd`, `ls`, `exit`, etc.) to perform specific actions.
- Experiment with input/output redirection and other shell functionalities.
- Refer to the provided documentation and practice exercises to enhance your understanding of C programming and Linux system calls.
